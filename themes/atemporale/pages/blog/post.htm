                    <p>Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p>
                    <p>I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.</p>
                    <p>But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn.</p>
